Welcome youngster! You are planning to do some gardening next to my home? You have my permission to do so! Would you like some lunch? Ohohohoo!
The new field is looking great! Soon we won’t need to rely upon our stockpile. Everyone is grateful for the hard work that you all have put in.
It’s incredible what you’ve managed to produce with such limited resources.
The food that you’re producing is vital to our effort to create a better future for humanity. Solidarity forever comrades.
