The community forum is now up and running. It will allow us to keep in touch and to coordinate the running of the zone. Be sure to tell your neighbours and ask them to make an account. The more people we have involved the stronger we are.
As members of the Gardener’s Council, we are counting on you to turn empty plots and unused rooftops into gardens. We have limited stockpiles, so you need to start producing quickly!

Welcome youngster! You are planning to do some gardening next to my home? You have my permission to do so! Would you like some lunch? Ohohohoo!
The new field is looking great! Soon we won’t need to rely upon our stockpile. Everyone is grateful for the hard work that you all have put in.
It’s incredible what you’ve managed to produce with such limited resources.
The food that you’re producing is vital to our effort to create a better future for humanity. Solidarity forever comrades.
Oh hey! Did you get our message about expanding the gardener’s collective here? One of my boyfriends used to work in conservation, so I’m sure they’ll be helpful.
Yeah? I’m not interested. Do what you want with the square, but I don’t want any part of it.
It is lovely to see our city like it used to be! When I was young, we all grew our own food! Even the children helped harvest it. Ohoho ohohoho!
Raised beds on roofs and windows can provide vital supplements to our food production. That they also make the city look pretty is an added bonus!
By utilising every available space we can ensure plenty even despite the government’s blockade.
Our comrades in communes across the country are with us. No matter the size, every new garden is another step towards a better world.
Thanks for your message (you spoke to Theo, my bf). Yeah, I even have a chainsaw licence! If you’re not already doing so, can I recommend using companion planting for natural protection against diseases and pests? W.B.
I’ll take some of those leeks. The garden looks good, but you’re dreamin’ if you think this will last.

We really need to increase food production. People are hungry and getting restless. We can’t let this be for nothing.
We know that you’re trying your best, but if we can’t show people that we can provide for them, they’re going to abandon us. A revolution marches on its stomach.
We need to increase food production. I know that we’ve heard the news about the other communes. We can’t let this one fail.
Things are looking desperate. A small group of people just tried to leave the city and government forces fired on them. You need to start producing more food. Our choice can’t be to starve or be shot.

Eat and drink well tonight comrades! We can’t fail if production remains this high!
We heard news overnight that another city has risen up and declared itself part of the national commune. The government is on the backfoot and soon will collapse!

Oh dear, I can’t cook you proper supper, my pantry is running low! Even the mice have lost weight around here. Is there something we could do to fix the situation?
I wish there was something else we could do, but we’re already only eating one meal a day. Fuck the fascists in the capital and the filth that enforce their blockade! We can’t let another commune fall.
It’s always the same story. People come promisin’ the world, they take what they want and they’re gone.

I heard that another city has declared itself part of the commune. Hope feels like a beautiful and delicate thing. What if things actually turn out well for once?
I guess things are goin’ okay? But I still don’t see why you have to be so confrontational though.
